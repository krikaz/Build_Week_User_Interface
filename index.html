              CosoNostra Pizza Inc., but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince.
              Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that's
              striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit

              villain threatening to bring about infocalypse. Snow Crash is a
              mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so

            <h3 class='title'>Gardens of the Moon</h3>
            <p class='author'>Steven Erikson</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by
              interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations
              with the formidable Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii, ancient
              and implacable sorcerers. Even the imperial legions, long inured
              to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's
              rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins. For
              Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for
              Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the
              aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn
              the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of
              Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that
              Laseen turns her predatory gaze. However, it would appear that the
              Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound
              forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their
              hand... Conceived and written on a panoramic scale, Gardens of the
              Moon is epic fantasy of the highest order--an enthralling
              adventure by an outstanding new voice.

              In the Name of Rome: The Men Who Won the Roman Empire
            </h3>
            <p class='author'>Adrian Goldsworthy</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              The complete and definitive history of how Roman generals carved
              out the greatest and longest-lasting empire the world has ever
              seen. The Roman army was one of the most effective fighting forces
              in history. The legions and their commanders carved out an empire
              which eventually included the greater part of the known world.
              This was thanks largely to the generals who led the Roman army to
              victory after victory, and whose strategic and tactical decisions
              shaped the course of several centuries of warfare. This book, by
              the author of THE PUNIC WARS, concentrates on those Roman generals
              who displayed exceptional gifts of leadership and who won the
              greatest victories. With 26 chapters covering the entire span of
              the Roman Empire, it is a complete history of Roman warfare.

            <h3 class='title'>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</h3>
            <p class='author'>Steven Levy</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              A mere fifteen years ago, computer nerds were seen as marginal
              weirdos, outsiders whose world would never resonate with the
              mainstream. That was before one pioneering work documented the
              underground computer revolution that was about to change our world
              forever. With groundbreaking profiles of Bill Gates, Steve
              Wozniak, MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club, and more, Steven Levy's
              Hackers brilliantly captured a seminal moment when the risk-takers
              and explorers were poised to conquer twentieth-century America's
              last great frontier. And in the Internet age, the hacker
              ethic-first espoused here-is alive and well.
