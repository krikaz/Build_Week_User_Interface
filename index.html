            <p class="author">Steven Erikson</p>
            <p class="sypnosis">
              The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by
              interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations
              with the formidable Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii, ancient
              and implacable sorcerers. Even the imperial legions, long inured
              to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's
              rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins. For
              Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for
              Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the
              aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn
              the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of
              Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that
              Laseen turns her predatory gaze. However, it would appear that the
              Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound
              forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their
              hand... Conceived and written on a panoramic scale, Gardens of the
              Moon is epic fantasy of the highest order--an enthralling
              adventure by an outstanding new voice.

              In the Name of Rome: The Men Who Won the Roman Empire
            </h3>
            <p class="author">Adrian Goldsworthy</p>
            <p class="sypnosis">
              The complete and definitive history of how Roman generals carved
              out the greatest and longest-lasting empire the world has ever
              seen. The Roman army was one of the most effective fighting forces
              in history. The legions and their commanders carved out an empire
              which eventually included the greater part of the known world.
              This was thanks largely to the generals who led the Roman army to
              victory after victory, and whose strategic and tactical decisions
              shaped the course of several centuries of warfare. This book, by
              the author of THE PUNIC WARS, concentrates on those Roman generals
              who displayed exceptional gifts of leadership and who won the
              greatest victories. With 26 chapters covering the entire span of
              the Roman Empire, it is a complete history of Roman warfare.

              A mere fifteen years ago, computer nerds were seen as marginal

              Hackers brilliantly captured a seminal moment when the risk-takers

            <h3 class="title">Why We Sleep</h3>
            <p class="author">Matthew Walker</p>
            <p class="sypnosis">
              Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of
              our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science
              had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it
              served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when
              we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating,
              drinking, and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remained elusive.
              An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years
              has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now,
              preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us
              a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming.
              Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize,
              and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks
              our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our
              appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a
              virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present
              knowledge to inspire creativity.

            <p class="sypnosis">
              Before the Internet became widely known as a global tool for
              terrorists, one perceptive U.S. citizen recognized its ominous
              potential. Armed with clear evidence of computer espionage, he
              began a highly personal quest to expose a hidden network of spies
              that threatened national security. But would the authorities back
              him up? Cliff Stoll's dramatic firsthand account is "a
              computer-age detective story, instantly fascinating [and]
              astonishingly gripping" (Smithsonian). Cliff Stoll was an
              astronomer turned systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley Lab when a
              75-cent accounting error alerted him to the presence of an
              unauthorized user on his system. The hacker's code name was
              "Hunter" -- a mysterious invader who managed to break into U.S.
              computer systems and steal sensitive military and security
              information. Stoll began a one-man hunt of his own: spying on the
              spy. It was a dangerous game of deception, broken codes,
              satellites, and missile bases -- a one-man sting operation that
              finally gained the attention of the CIA...and ultimately trapped
              an international spy ring fueled by cash, cocaine, and the KGB.

              Technology controls almost everything in our modern-day world,

              flight controls of our airplanes to the movements of the entire

              the background of our lives, trafficking e-mail, transferring
              money, and monitoring power grids. For the most part, daemons are
              benign, but the same can't always be said for the people who
              design them. Matthew Sobol was a legendary computer game
              designer—the architect behind half-a-dozen popular online games.
              His premature death depressed both gamers and his company's stock
              price. But Sobol's fans aren't the only ones to note his passing.
              When his obituary is posted online, a previously dormant daemon
              activates, initiating a chain of events intended to unravel the
              fabric of our hyper-efficient, interconnected world. With Sobol's
              secrets buried along with him, and as new layers of his daemon are
              unleashed at every turn, it's up to an unlikely alliance to
              decipher his intricate plans and wrest the world from the grasp of
              a nameless, faceless enemy—or learn to live in a society in which
              we are no longer in control. . . .

              Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the
              seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades
              and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning,
              and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and
              supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective
              Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell,
              a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to.
              Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime
              kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies,
              soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together
              in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear
              swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men
              off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister
              to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most
              treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and
              betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their
              allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each

                Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.

                It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.
                
                One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.

                Over the past two decades, Antony Beevor has established himself as one of the world's premier historians of WWII. His multi-award winning books have included Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945. Now, in his newest and most ambitious book, he turns his focus to one of the bloodiest and most tragic events of the twentieth century, the Second World War.

                In this searing narrative that takes us from Hitler's invasion of Poland on September 1st, 1939 to V-J day on August 14th, 1945 and the war's aftermath, Beevor describes the conflict and its global reach--one that included every major power. The result is a dramatic and breathtaking single-volume history that provides a remarkably intimate account of the war that, more than any other, still commands attention and an audience.
                
                Thrillingly written and brilliantly researched, Beevor's grand and provocative account is destined to become the definitive work on this complex, tragic, and endlessly fascinating period in world history, and confirms once more that he is a military historian of the first rank.

            <h3 class="title">Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</h3>
            <p class="author">Douglas R. Hofstadter</p>
            <p class="sypnosis">
                Douglas Hofstadter's book is concerned directly with the nature of “maps” or links between formal systems. However, according to Hofstadter, the formal system that underlies all mental activity transcends the system that supports it. If life can grow out of the formal chemical substrate of the cell, if consciousness can emerge out of a formal system of firing neurons, then so too will computers attain human intelligence. Gödel, Escher, Bach is a wonderful exploration of fascinating ideas at the heart of cognitive science: meaning, reduction, recursion, and much more.

            <h3 class="title">The 80/20 Principle</h3>
            <p class="author"> Richard Koch</p>
            <p class="sypnosis">
                How anyone can be more effective with less effort by learning how to identify and leverage the 80/20 principle--the well-known, unpublicized secret that 80 percent of all our results in business and in life stem from a mere 20 percent of our efforts.

                The 80/20 principle is one of the great secrets of highly effective people and organizations.
                
                Did you know, for example, that 20 percent of customers account for 80 percent of revenues? That 20 percent of our time accounts for 80 percent of the work we accomplish? The 80/20 Principle shows how we can achieve much more with much less effort, time, and resources, simply by identifying and focusing our efforts on the 20 percent that really counts. Although the 80/20 principle has long influenced today's business world, author Richard Koch reveals how the principle works and shows how we can use it in a systematic and practical way to vastly increase our effectiveness, and improve our careers and our companies.
