              In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's
              CosoNostra Pizza Inc., but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince.
              Plunging headlong into the enigma of a new computer virus that's
              striking down hackers everywhere, he races along the neon-lit
              streets on a search-and-destroy mission for the shadowy virtual
              villain threatening to bring about infocalypse. Snow Crash is a
              mind-altering romp through a future America so bizarre, so
              outrageous… you'll recognize it immediately.

            <h3 class='title'>Gardens of the Moon</h3>
            <p class='author'>Steven Erikson</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              The Malazan Empire simmers with discontent, bled dry by
              interminable warfare, bitter infighting and bloody confrontations
              with the formidable Anomander Rake and his Tiste Andii, ancient
              and implacable sorcerers. Even the imperial legions, long inured
              to the bloodshed, yearn for some respite. Yet Empress Laseen's
              rule remains absolute, enforced by her dread Claw assassins. For
              Sergeant Whiskeyjack and his squad of Bridgeburners, and for
              Tattersail, surviving cadre mage of the Second Legion, the
              aftermath of the siege of Pale should have been a time to mourn
              the many dead. But Darujhistan, last of the Free Cities of
              Genabackis, yet holds out. It is to this ancient citadel that
              Laseen turns her predatory gaze. However, it would appear that the
              Empire is not alone in this great game. Sinister, shadowbound
              forces are gathering as the gods themselves prepare to play their
              hand... Conceived and written on a panoramic scale, Gardens of the
              Moon is epic fantasy of the highest order--an enthralling
              adventure by an outstanding new voice.

              In the Name of Rome: The Men Who Won the Roman Empire
            </h3>
            <p class='author'>Adrian Goldsworthy</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              The complete and definitive history of how Roman generals carved
              out the greatest and longest-lasting empire the world has ever
              seen. The Roman army was one of the most effective fighting forces
              in history. The legions and their commanders carved out an empire
              which eventually included the greater part of the known world.
              This was thanks largely to the generals who led the Roman army to
              victory after victory, and whose strategic and tactical decisions
              shaped the course of several centuries of warfare. This book, by
              the author of THE PUNIC WARS, concentrates on those Roman generals
              who displayed exceptional gifts of leadership and who won the
              greatest victories. With 26 chapters covering the entire span of
              the Roman Empire, it is a complete history of Roman warfare.

            <h3 class='title'>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</h3>
            <p class='author'>Steven Levy</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              A mere fifteen years ago, computer nerds were seen as marginal
              weirdos, outsiders whose world would never resonate with the
              mainstream. That was before one pioneering work documented the
              underground computer revolution that was about to change our world
              forever. With groundbreaking profiles of Bill Gates, Steve
              Wozniak, MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club, and more, Steven Levy's
              Hackers brilliantly captured a seminal moment when the risk-takers
              and explorers were poised to conquer twentieth-century America's
              last great frontier. And in the Internet age, the hacker
              ethic-first espoused here-is alive and well.

            <p class='sypnosis'>
              Computers are everywhere. Some of them are highly visible, in laptops, tablets, cell phones, and smart watches. But most are invisible, like those in appliances, cars, medical equipment, transportation systems, power grids, and weapons. We never see the myriad computers that quietly collect, share, and sometimes leak vast amounts of personal data about us. Through computers, governments and companies increasingly monitor what we do. Social networks and advertisers know far more about us than we should be comfortable with, using information we freely give them. Criminals have all-too-easy access to our data. Do we truly understand the power of computers in our world?

            <h3 class='title'>Why We Sleep</h3>
            <p class='author'>Matthew Walker</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              Sleep is one of the most important but least understood aspects of our life, wellness, and longevity. Until very recently, science had no answer to the question of why we sleep, or what good it served, or why we suffer such devastating health consequences when we don't sleep. Compared to the other basic drives in life—eating, drinking, and reproducing—the purpose of sleep remained elusive.

An explosion of scientific discoveries in the last twenty years has shed new light on this fundamental aspect of our lives. Now, preeminent neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker gives us a new understanding of the vital importance of sleep and dreaming. Within the brain, sleep enriches our ability to learn, memorize, and make logical decisions. It recalibrates our emotions, restocks our immune system, fine-tunes our metabolism, and regulates our appetite. Dreaming mollifies painful memories and creates a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge to inspire creativity.

            <h3 class='title'>The Cuckoo's Egg</h3>
            <p class='author'>Clifford Stoll</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              Before the Internet became widely known as a global tool for terrorists, one perceptive U.S. citizen recognized its ominous potential. Armed with clear evidence of computer espionage, he began a highly personal quest to expose a hidden network of spies that threatened national security. But would the authorities back him up? Cliff Stoll's dramatic firsthand account is "a computer-age detective story, instantly fascinating [and] astonishingly gripping" (Smithsonian).
Cliff Stoll was an astronomer turned systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley Lab when a 75-cent accounting error alerted him to the presence of an unauthorized user on his system. The hacker's code name was "Hunter" -- a mysterious invader who managed to break into U.S. computer systems and steal sensitive military and security information. Stoll began a one-man hunt of his own: spying on the spy. It was a dangerous game of deception, broken codes, satellites, and missile bases -- a one-man sting operation that finally gained the attention of the CIA...and ultimately trapped an international spy ring fueled by cash, cocaine, and the KGB.

            <h3 class='title'>Daemon</h3>
            <p class='author'>Daniel Suarez</p>
            <p class='sypnosis'>
              Technology controls almost everything in our modern-day world, from remote entry on our cars to access to our homes, from the flight controls of our airplanes to the movements of the entire world economy. Thousands of autonomous computer programs, or daemons, make our networked world possible, running constantly in the background of our lives, trafficking e-mail, transferring money, and monitoring power grids. For the most part, daemons are benign, but the same can't always be said for the people who design them.

Matthew Sobol was a legendary computer game designer—the architect behind half-a-dozen popular online games. His premature death depressed both gamers and his company's stock price. But Sobol's fans aren't the only ones to note his passing. When his obituary is posted online, a previously dormant daemon activates, initiating a chain of events intended to unravel the fabric of our hyper-efficient, interconnected world. With Sobol's secrets buried along with him, and as new layers of his daemon are unleashed at every turn, it's up to an unlikely alliance to decipher his intricate plans and wrest the world from the grasp of a nameless, faceless enemy—or learn to live in a society in which we are no longer in control. . . .
